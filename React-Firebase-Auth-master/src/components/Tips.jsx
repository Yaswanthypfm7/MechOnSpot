<p>
As a car owner, you need to be able to recognize when something is amiss with your vehicle. Some issues that occur with your car are relatively minor annoyances that don’t necessarily require professional auto repair. The items on the following list are not in that category. If you experience any of the following signs with your car, then you need immediate auto service.
</p>

<h3>1. Smoke Blowing from Under the Hood</h3>
<p>Something is seriously wrong if your car has smoke coming from under the hood. It could be a sign that the engine is overheating. Continuing to drive at that point will cause serious damage.
If you are in the middle of the road, pull over and wait for the engine to cool down. Call for a tow truck to take your car to a repair shop right away.</p>
<h3>2. Check Engine Light is Flashing</h3>

<p>If the light is illuminated, it’s a sign to take your car to the nearest shop. It’s impossible to know exactly what the problem is simply because the light is on.

However, if the light is flashing, you need to have a mechanic check your car right away. It may be a sign that there is a problem with your emissions system.
</p><h3>3. Transmission Problems (Sudden or Recurring)</h3>

<p>Pay close attention to how your car is operating on a regular basis. If you notice that it has surges or is sluggish reaching certain speeds, you’ll want to take it to a mechanic for immediate auto service.</p>
<h3>4. Noises While Driving</h3>

<p>If your car is making grinding or squealing sounds while driving, it may indicate faulty brakes. A dragging or droning sound could be linked to an issue with your wheel bearings. Either way, you need a licensed technician to check it out.</p>
<h3>5. Leaks Under your Car</h3>

<p>Don’t ignore fluid leaks under your car where you usually park. Bright green fluid is from anti-freeze. Dark red or brown fluid could be engine oil, brake fluid, or transmission fluid. Your mechanic can determine the cause of the leak and make the necessary repair for you before it leads to further damage.
